      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that a website stores on your computer.
        We will use cookies on the Website similar to other lending websites
        and online marketplace websites. Use of this information helps us
        identify you in order to make our web portal more users friendly. We
        might also use this information to display advertising from third
        party companies. Most browsers will let you decline cookies but if you
        choose to do this it might affect service on some parts of the
        Website.<br />
        <br />
        We might also use other technology to track how you interact with our
        portal and employ some third party agencies to use the data on our
        behalf.
      </p>

        internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
        provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
        stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically

        protect your information using physical, technical, and administrative
        security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized

        firewalls and data encryption using SSL, and information access
        authorization controls.<br />

        beyond our reasonable control and you shall not be entitled to hold
        the Company responsible or liable for any breach of security. The
        company also assumes no responsibility for the documents and other
