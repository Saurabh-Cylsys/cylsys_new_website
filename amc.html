              As mandated by SEBI all AMCs have to do the valuation of bonds
              on a daily basis. The process followed is the AMC receives a
              mail from either CRISIL or ICRA on a daily basis at 4.30 p.m.
              and this mail needs to be replied by the Fund Managers of AMCs
              after entering the necessary data in the attached Excel sheet on
              the same day, latest by 5.15 p.m. All this data needs to be
              stored and preserved for approximately 8 years.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="subheading">
              This entire process was being done manually which was very
              cumbersome and time consuming. So to enhance the process and
              optimize the resources it was decided to automate this entire
              process and store the required data in a database by developing
              an application for the same.

              Medical Reimbursement and CHC Systems
            </h2>
            <h3 class="subheading px-md-5">
              One of the leading Mutual fund Investment companies in India. It
              is the seventh-largest Asset management company in India. The
              AMC was looking for an IT partner to implement their Medical
              Reimbursement and Comprehensive Health Check up system for their
              employees (Approximately 1400) using the latest technology with
              existing cloud Infrastructure. They were using a mix of manual
              and system driven technology to process these functions which
              was time-consuming and prone to errors. Cylsys Software created
              a robust and Easy to use system which made the entire process
              digital and thereby saving time and aiding the team to execute
              the entire process accurately and seamlessly. The new system
              made sure that Employees were able to register their Medical
              claims or requests for a Comprehensive Health check up with
              utmost ease. The new system also made a huge positive difference
              to the Medical Administrators at client AMC in executing
              processes like checking the claims, giving sanctions, releasing
              the sanctioned amount payments into Employee’s salary accounts
              in record turnaround time. It was a win-win situation for all
              the parties involved.

              relationships which those Employees are handling for that
              location /Branch. This Employee movement compels the smooth
              transfer of Business relationships or Mapping in the system from
              the Old employee to the new Employee at that location /Branch.
              This Application automates the entire Mapping process which was
              manual with its own share of manual interventions and
              rectification of errors , standardizes all the Masters and its
              maintenance and streamlines the entire process for all the
